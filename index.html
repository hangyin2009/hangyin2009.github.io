			<h2>Biography [<a href="./Resume_Hang_Yin.pdf" target= "_blank">CV</a>]</h2>
			<p>
				I am a Master Graduate in Mechanical engineering from University of Colorado at Boulder and now work at <a href="https://tamaki-control.com/" target= "_blank">Tamaki Control</a> as an Automation Engineer. At CU Boulder, I worked on designing a micro-stereolithography system to fabricate bio-compatible 3D structures. I received my Master of Science in ME and was supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xblab2000/" target= "_blank">Prof.Xiaobo Yin</a> and <a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~wtan/people.html" target= "_blank">Prof.Wei Tan</a>. Before graduate school, I received my Bachelor degree in Astronautical Engineering at Beihang University in China.
				<br>
				<br>
				My research interests include Soft Robotics, Electro-Mechanical System, Multiscale 3D printing. In particular, I am interested in developing biomimetic robots with intelligent material and algorithm.

						<h3>A self-driving, target-sensing ping-pong ball shooting robot</h3>
						<p>Hang Yin, Xuyue Shi, Yibo Yuan, Zikai Xu</p>
						We designed a self-driving, target-sensing robot that can accurately launch pin-pong balls as a team of 4 people. The control for motion, sensing and lauching system is realized by Arduino and mbed k64f. Most parts of the robot are made from laser cut board and 3D printing.

					<h3>PillOne Dispenser</h3>
						<p>Sreyas Krishnan, Michael Lippert, Roshan Misra, Hang Yin</p>
						We designed a feasible prototype for a medication dispenser for individuals with early stage motor skill disorders such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease and arthritis as a team of 4 people. Through multiple design iterations, extensive user testing, and feedback from individuals with motor control impairment a robust and functional prototype was conceived and built.
