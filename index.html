			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>
				I am a Master Graduate in Mechanical engineering from University of Colorado at Boulder and now work at Tamaki Control as an Automation Engineer. At CU Boulder, I worked on designing a micro-stereolithography system to fabricate bio-compatible 3D structures. I received my Master of Science in ME and was supervised by Prof.Xiaobo Yin and Prof.Wei Tan. Before graduate school, I received my Bachelor degree in Astronautical Engineering at Beihang University in China.

						We designed a self-navigated, multi-directional driving robot that can accurately launch pin-pong balls as a team of 4 people. The control for motion, sensing and lauching system is realized by Arduino and mbed k64f. Most parts of the robot are made from laser cut board and 3D printing.
